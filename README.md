# CherryHarmony
A fantasy turn based tactics game, developed with Georgia Tech's VGDev club.

## Style/Convention suggestions
* If a method is going over a page in length, consider chunking it into multiple methods
* I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity) as my editor.
  * You can use alt+shift+f to auto-format to the project's formatting settings
* Read through the `Util` class before reimplementing a common function/field
  * There are some instances of axes being swapped. Util's `WorldToGrid` and `GridToWorld` handles this. Sorry.
